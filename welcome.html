			MAFA is a free online bioinformatics tool that has been optimized to carry out functional annotation processes over large numbers of nucleotide sequences (genomes and transcriptomes). Moreover, MAFA includes additional tools to perform categorization and statistical analysis of the corresponding sequence-ontology associations. MAFA is intended to operate by a web interface making the functional annotation a simple process (almost  intuitive) for biologist.
